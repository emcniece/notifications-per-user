For instance, you might be a developer making a blog for a client - you use the superadmin account for yourself, but have no interest in the comments that the client gets on their posts. With this plugin, you can select the users that should get these emails!Notifications Per User takes advantage of a WordPress 3.7 update that introduced a few filters to the *wp_notify_moderator()* function - specifically, *comment_moderation_recipients*. By altering the email list that this filter grants access to, we can add or remove email addresses at will. Note that by default, only users with the Moderator role or greater normally have access to these email notifications - so despite the fact that this setting appears for lower-role users, it may have no effect on the normal operation of the site.How to use:1.
